# stufflogger

Basic logging for keyboard inputs, screen captures, and processes  
Was made for a specific purpose and will probably not be updated.  
I am not responsible for any misuse of this program.  

## Usage
Create a venv and install the requirements:  
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run `python3 main.py --config default.txt` to start logging.
